Main content has 2 different colours (white and grey),text in black and footer on the bottom of the page with a "Thank you for playing this game" text.


## AS A USER

* I want the game to have higher difficulty.
* I want to easily understand the main purpose of the game.
* I want random choices of words (10000).
* I want to be able to see how many attemps I have left.
* I want the option to play again.

#### Site Goals:
